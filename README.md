QLab-CasparCG-Atem-Bridge
=========================

Mac Bridge between QLab, CasparCG and ATEM built specifically so that it can be triggered via Applescript (use the Accessibility Inspector to determine field/button references).

Not much too this App, enter the CasparCG IP address and port, click Connect.

Once it connects, it will display a Text Field and Send button at the bottom to allow for any command to be sent to CasparCG.

You can enter any [AMCP](http://casparcg.com/wiki/CasparCG_2.0_AMCP_Protocol) command into the Text Field. The required "\r\n" will automatically be appended to the string.

Near the top it will also display a section for trigging a countdown timer in CasparCG. The Flash template is based heavily on the countdown timer provided by [tsipas](http://casparcg.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=695) on the [CasparCG forums](http://casparcg.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1114&p=6225).
